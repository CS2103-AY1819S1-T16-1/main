== PROJECT: WishBook

---

== Overview

WishBook is a desktop savings assistant application written in Java, built for people who want to set savings goals (Wishes)
and keep track of their progress in saving toward those wishes.
It is created by Team T16-1 for CS2103T: Software Engineering module offered by School of Computing,
National University of Singapore, in AY2018/2019 Semester 1.
This project portfolio consists of the contributions I have made to WishBook over the semester.

== Summary of contributions

=== Major Enhancements
* *Move Command*: added Move Command
** *What it does*: Allows users to move funds between wishes, or to transfer between wishes and the unused funds.
** *Justification*: Previously, to reallocate funds from one wish to another, the user had to save a negated amount from one of their wishes,
and then save that positive amount into the targeted wish.
It can be quite troublesome to shift funds between wishes, as the user would have to type two separate commands.
As such, I developed the move command that allows the user to transfer funds between wishes directly in a single command.

* *Save to unused funds*:
** *What it does*: Allow users to save toward unused funds directly. Also, any excess saved amount will be channelled automatically to unused funds.
** *Justification*: Previously, if the input amount causes the wishâ€™s saved amount to exceed its price,
the excess amount would be stored inside that wish.
However, this excess amount cannot be reallocated, since the wish has already been fulfilled.
Thus, I modified the Save command to channel any excess saved amount to an UnusedFunds within WishBook.
The money inside the UnusedFunds can later be redistributed to other wishes, via the Move Command.

=== Minor Enhancements
* *Savings History*: add option to show savings history for History Command.

* *List*: add option to display only completed or uncompleted wishes.

=== Other Contributions
** Shorthand alias: Add shorthand equivalent alias for commands.
*** Useful to increase speed and efficiency while using WishBook
*** users would now be able to type a command with only 1 or 2 characters, instead of typing the whole word.
(Pull Request https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-1/main/pull/3[#3])
** Documentation:
*** Documented new functions added to User Guide.
*** Consistently updated the User Guide to reflect the current function usage in our application.
*** Refactored Developer Guide to make it specific to our WishBook implementation.

** Refactored code and documentation
*** Contributed regularly to refactoring the code from the previous AddressBook-Level 4 application.
*** Refactor terms specific to AddressBook-Level 4, to suit our current WishBook application
